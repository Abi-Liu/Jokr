# Introduction

This is a Full-stack joke sharing app called Jokr. I built this app using the MVC Architecture to organize and structure my code. I have also implemented "authorization" so users can sign up, and keep track of the jokes they post.

# Technologies

For this app I used Node.js, Express.js, Javascript, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, and Bootstrap for styling.

# Objectives
